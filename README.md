[Link to exercises](https://github.com/cruzgerman216/CodeLabs-Ruby-on-Rails-Exercises) <br>
Here is a list of ruby terms and definitions used in class.

## Part 1 
<em>**Layer of Abstraction**</em> - Layers of abstraction represent how far removed an individual is from the first level of programming required to operate a system. Users interact at lower levels of abstraction. More specific developing languages are built upon lower level languages and operate at higher levels of abstraction. <br>
<em>**Data Type**</em> - Data types are the different types of data, or classes of data. <br>
<em>**Variable**</em> - Variables are used to represent a location in memory where data is stored to be accessed later as the program runs. <br>
<em>**What's the difference between a local variable, constant variable, and a global variable?**</em> - A local variable is only available within the method in which it is declared. A constant variable is immutable and its value cannot be changed. A global variable is accessible throughout a program.<br>
<em>**What does scope mean?**</em> - Scope defines the range of accessibility of a variable. For example, a local variable is only accessible within its method, while a global variable is accessible throughout a program. <br>
<em>**Constant Variable**</em> - A constant variable is an immutable piece of data, whose value cannot be changed. It can be local or global and will be indicated by capitalization. <br>
<em>**Method**</em> - A method is a bundle of code grouped together to perform a specific task or produce a result. It is given a name so that it can be called repeatedly without rewriting the code each instance. <br>
<em>**IRB**</em> - Interactive Ruby (IRB) is a console in which code can be written and then will read, evaluate, print, and return immediate results for testing and debugging. <br>
<em>**Operators**</em> - An operator is a symbol that represents an operation on an object. Operators include mathematical, comparison, and logical operations. <br>
<em>**Class**</em> - Class is similar to type of an object in that it defines or explains the object. Each object is an instance of the class to which it belongs. <br>
<em>**Gem**</em> - A gem is a pre-built software package in Ruby, which contain libraries or applications to be used as shortcuts to automate certain repetitive tasks or speed up basic code building. <br>

## Part 2
<em>**Conditional**</em> - Conditionals determine whether certain conditions are met and if a set of instructions should be run or not. <br>
<em>**The difference between if, elseif and else.**</em> - If determines if a condition has been met. Elseif gives a set of instructions to run if the first (if) condition has not been met. Else is a final (optional) statement for use when none of the above conditions are met and alternate instructions should be processed.<br>
<em>**What are Case/When statements? </em> - When a stated case or condition is met, then return a given response, as in a switch statement. <br>
<em>**What is a data structure? </em> - Data structure is a to organize and access data. Examples are: arrays, trees, hashes, lists, stacks, and sets. <br>
<em>**Arrays**</em> - Arrays are ordered, indexed collections of objects. These objects are integer-indexed, starting at 0. The objects can be of any type, such as strings, integers, hashes, or other arrays. <br>
<em>**What is meant by 'built-in' methods?**</em> - Built-in methods are predefined by Ruby to reduce manual calculation and coding time by the developer. This creates easily repeatable methods to increase performance, speed, and efficiency. <br>
<em>**Loops**</em> - Loops will repeat the same line or block of code a specified number of times, or until a specified condition is met. <br>
<em>**What are infinite loops?**</em> - An infinite loop is a loop that never reaches a breaking point, does not contain a specified end, and/or meets the specified condition laid out in the code. It will run forever unless manually broken. <br>
